BazaarPlusPlus is an open-source project for *The Bazaar*. The in-game BepInEx mod adds a card collection browser, run history, combat replays, tooltip previews, anonymous mode, Chinese terminology, and related quality-of-life features. The companion desktop installer handles download, install, repair, auto-update, and the stream overlay.

This project is a fork of [BazaarPlusPlus](https://github.com/cauyxy/BazaarPlusPlus); it primarily adds Linux Steam client compatibility and source-build workflows.

> The bulk of the codebase is led by [Codex](https://openai.com/codex), with collaboration from [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code).

## Quick Start

### Windows / macOS

1. Open [bazaarplusplus.com/download](https://bazaarplusplus.com/download?lang=en) and choose the installer for your system.
2. Close the game before running the installer. For updates, uninstall the old build before installing the new one.
3. Launch *The Bazaar* once after installation so BazaarPlusPlus can finish setup.
4. On the main menu, confirm that the **Card Collection** button appears and the footer version text includes `BPP version`.

Feature guides, hotkeys, and installation details live at [bazaarplusplus.com/tutorial](https://bazaarplusplus.com/tutorial?lang=en).

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

Build the `.deb` package from source and install it manually.

## Feature Overview

### In-Game Mod

- **Card Collection**: Browse items and skills in-game, with filters for hero, tier, size, merchant, and current run day.
- **BazaarDB Auto Upload**: Community-data contribution that uploads end-of-run screenshots and board data in the background. Disabled by default; opt-in only.
- **Run History and Combat Replay**: Press `F8` to browse past runs and key fights, and watch replays and ghost battles.
- **Combat Status Bar**: Shows combat time and pause state, with speed controls — handy for review, recording, and streaming.
- **Anonymous Mode**: Hide the local player name in screenshots, recordings, and streams.
- **Legendary Rank Display**: Hide your rank, show an exaggerated power value, or display rank and rating together.
- **Enchant and Upgrade Previews**: Preview post-enchant or post-upgrade item values directly in tooltips.
- **Chinese Terminology Modes**: Simplified Chinese plus Taiwan and Hong Kong Traditional terminology styles.

### Desktop Installer

- **Cross-platform install**: Windows, macOS, and Linux Steam Proton environments, with automatic Steam game-directory detection.
- **Linux Proton support**: On Linux, installs the Windows Doorstop/BepInEx payload for Proton and writes the `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp=n,b" %command%` launch option automatically.
- **Repair / uninstall / reset local data**: Recover from broken installs, replay-data issues, or local-state corruption.
- **Run history management**: View, locate, and clean up locally saved run records and replay videos.
- **Stream Mode**: Start a localhost browser-source service for OBS and similar tools.
- **Auto-update**: Uses Tauri Updater to check for new releases and prompt when available.

## Building From Source

### Prerequisites

- **Mod**: .NET SDK 8+ and a local Steam install of *The Bazaar* so game assemblies can be resolved.
- **Installer**: Node.js 20+, the Rust toolchain, and the system dependencies listed in the [Tauri prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).
- **Windows**: PowerShell 7.6.0 or newer for the build scripts and development flow.
- **Linux**: The Steam Linux client and a Proton install of *The Bazaar* are needed for local testing. Production packaging creates a `.deb` and requires the usual Tauri Linux packaging dependencies. If `zip` is unavailable, the build script falls back to `7z` when creating the Linux payload resource archive.

### Build the Mod

```bash
cd bazaarplusplus-mod

# Development build: resolves the local game directory and copies the Debug DLL into BepInEx/plugins
./run.sh build

# Build Debug + Release in one pass
./run.sh all

# Override the game assembly directory explicitly
dotnet build src/BazaarPlusPlus/BazaarPlusPlus.csproj \
  -c Debug \
  -p:ManagedPath="<Steam>/steamapps/common/The Bazaar/.../Managed"
```

### Build the Installer

```bash
cd bazaarplusplus-installer

npm install
npm run dev        # Vite frontend dev server
npm run tauri dev  # full Tauri desktop app

npm run check
npm run test
npm run format

./build.sh --prod  # production package for the host platform; creates a .deb on Linux
```

Before packaging, the script syncs versions, runs prebuild checks, and validates the BepInEx payload needed for the current host platform. Linux builds do not commit a pregenerated zip; `./build.sh --prod` creates `BepInExSource/linux/BepInEx.zip` from `src-tauri/resources/SourceForBuild/windows` for Proton, then asks Tauri to bundle only the `.deb`.

Release signing, notarization, and R2 upload flows depend on local environment variables and `signing-secrets/`, which are intentionally not committed. Local Linux `.deb` builds do not require the updater signing key. A full release build also requires a local game install, signing material, and the platform dependencies — the public source tree alone is not enough.
